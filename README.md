# 🐳 World Wide Whale 🐳

You are the **World Wide Whale**. Someone downloaded you off of a suspicious internet link and executed you without regard for security. Now you reside in the RAM of their computer.

(You are a piece of malware.)

This is a 2D platformer game wherein you do unsavory cyber-un-secure things to a computer (please please please in-game only not in real life!!). Hopefully you learn some computer architecture along the way.

### Origins

Some permutation of this idea has been in the back of my mind for a couple months now; WHACK 2025 (hackathon at Wellesley) finally gave me the opportunity to drag it out & make it. Much thanks to our excellent and lovely teammates Jessy Wang, Elena Jin, and Camille Yang. 🩵

(This was my first hackathon ever & such a good introduction to hackathons.)
